Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date. We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, protect, optimize and improve our Services, and to enhance our user experience. For instance, we may use the information we collect in the following ways:
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            Usage Information. We use Usage Information for general purposes: to enhance or otherwise improve the Services, to customize our content and the offers for financial products and services you see, to develop new services, conduct research, and provide anonymous or aggregated reporting internally and to our business partners. We do not store your Personal Information in cookies or log files on your Device, but identifiers in such cookies or log files may be tied to your Personal Information in our systems.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            Special Offers and Updates. We use information we collect in providing the Services, including Personal Information, to match you with offers for financial products and services. Generally, we will display these offers when you access our web or mobile Services, but we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions, by email or other electronic messaging. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of email or electronic messaging communications by logging into your account and visiting the "My Profile" page or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            Service-related Announcements. We will send you service-related announcements. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these non-promotional communications. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to terminate your account.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            Push Notifications. If you use our Mobile Applications, we may send you push notifications from time-to-time via our Mobile Application in order to provide or alert you to service-related announcements or information on products, services, special deals, or promotions. If you do not wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off in your mobile Device settings.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            Customer Service. When you first register for the Services, we may send you an introductory email welcoming you to SlingShot. We may also communicate with you via email or other means in response to your inquiries and to manage your account. As described above in “Information You Provide About A Third Party,” we may also use information you provide about others to send invitation e-mails as part of our referral program.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Personal Information): (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, governmental request or legal process if in our good faith opinion such action is required or permitted by law; (ii) to enforce the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, integrity, rights, property or security of our Services or equipment or those of any third party; or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Further, we may use IP addresses or other Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion. Any such access, use, preservation, transfer or disclosure may be carried out without notice to you.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            3. How Is Your Information Shared?
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            SlingShot does not share, sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for any purpose except in the following circumstances:
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            With Your Consent. We will share your Personal Information with parties outside of SlingShot when we have your consent.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            When You Choose to Provide Information to Third Parties. As part of the Services, you may be presented with opportunities for additional financial products or services that may require submitting information to unaffiliated third parties. For example, you may be asked to respond to offers provided by our marketing partners or presented with co-branded services we provide in association with third parties such as our marketing partners, business partners, or sponsors. These opportunities vary from day to day, but we will identify the relevant third party and in general, if you are interested in a particular offer or co-branded service, you will be taken to a third party site to complete the transaction or asked to submit information to the third party through a form on our site. When you are asked to provide information to a third party in connection with such offers or co-branded services, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. We will treat information we collect in connection with a particular offer or co-branded service in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. For more information, see "Information Third Parties Collect."
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            When You Disclose Information Publicly. The Services may permit you to submit ideas, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, "User Content"), that is publicly viewable (such as the public portions of your user profile or comments you post on our publicly accessible blog). We or others may reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed). Third parties may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it further with third parties across the Internet. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. SlingShot does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you disclose publicly or share with others, whether through the Services or otherwise. For additional information regarding our policies relating to User Content, please see our User Content Rules.

          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            To request removal of your Personal Information from User Content, contact us at hello@slingshot.flights. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information from such User Content, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            When Third Parties Provide Services on Our Behalf. We may use third party service providers or vendors to support or perform certain aspects of the Services on our or your behalf, such as hosting the Services, designing or operating the Services’ features, tracking the Services’ analytics, providing data used, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Services, marketing the Services, enabling SlingShot to contact you with offers or performing other administrative services. We may provide these third party service providers or vendors with access to user information, including Personal Information, in connection with the services they are performing for you or for us. In connection with our Services, these third party service providers or vendors may also set and access their own cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device, and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you.

          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            We may work with third-party advertising networks, marketing partners, publishers and other entities ("Advertising Service Providers") to perform analytics and advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us. In connection with these advertising services, we or our Advertising Service Providers, like Google Analytics (discussed below) may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect behavioral information about how you use our site or other websites in order to perform tracking and marketing analytics or serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you ("Interest-Based Advertisements"). Our Advertising Service Providers may permit you to opt-out of all or some Interest-Based Advertisements on designated websites. For example, many of our Advertising Service Providers participate in the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out program or Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out program.

            Terminating Your Account
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            If you wish to terminate your account with us, please follow the instructions detailed in the Terms of Use. SlingShot must comply with certain recordkeeping and information retention requirements. Therefore, we cannot delete your account information outright when you request to terminate your account. However, we will disable your account, which will be inactive and not accessible to anyone other than SlingShot authorized personnel. Moreover, once your account is terminated, you will not receive any further communications from SlingShot. Except to the extent necessary for legal or regulatory recordkeeping purposes, your data will be anonymized after a period of two years and then may be held by us indefinitely. It may take an additional limited period of time for our automated backup systems to process the anonymized accounts.

            Your California Privacy Rights
          </p>
          <p class="p-small font-grey">
            California’s "Shine the Light" law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers (those who have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not share customer information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and California’s Shine the Light law therefore does not apply to SlingShot.
